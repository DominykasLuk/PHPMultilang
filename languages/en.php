    <p>1907 On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the victory over Napoleon, a monument to Borussia,
    also known as the Nationaldenkmal, was unveiled. At that time, Klaipeda was the only Prussian city not
    occupied by Napoleon's army, where King Frederick Wilhelm III of Prussia and Queen Louise found
    refuge. The monument was erected in front of the Town Hall, the former home of the merchant
    Consentius, from 1807 to 1808. who lived in a royal couple and who had become a temporary residence
    in Prussia.</p>
    <p>The monument was created by Professor Peter Breuer, a sculptor from Charlottenburg, Germany. The
    project was edited by King Wilhelm II himself, who also attended the opening ceremony.
    The bronze four-meter-high sculpture was brought by train from Berlin. Prussia (which was called
    'Borussia' in Latin) was symbolized by a woman in antique clothing, with a Roman helmet on her head.
    The sculpture Borussia held a shield and a spear in his left hand (a sign with the words 'Borussia'
    attached to the spear) and a dagger in his right.</p>
    <p>In the original model, the woman held a shrunken chain, symbolizing the liberation of the German nation.
    However, the chain was replaced by a dagger. Borussia, similar to the ancient Greek goddess Athens, was
    erected on a cylindrical granite pedestal with cannulae, and this one with a sculpture was placed on a
    stepped granite foundation. The cylindrical pedestal was decorated with oval bas-reliefs. In one of them
    there are portraits of Friedrich Wilhelm III and his wife Louise, in the other the year: 1807–1907. Oval
    flange with bronze garlands. 1924 On the right side of the monument stood the hermits: granite square

        surrounded by Dutch-style fortifications. Dikes and bastions about 3.5 m high were dug around it, and

        beginning. Later, the ramparts were reconstructed in the 18th century. in the middle. The system of
        fortifications in Klaipėda (Memelis) at that time was complicated. As the city was surrounded on the east
        and south by bastion fortifications, and from the north it was protected by the New Dane River, so it was
        possible to enter the city only through the gates called Tilta, Kūliai (Akmenai) and Malūnai. The latter two
        were installed under the embankment.</p>

       about 300 workers. With the outbreak of World War II, the plant closed down due to a shortage of raw
       materials and coal. In the post-war period, shareholders were reluctant to resume factory operations.

        <p>The Devils Stone, 4 meters long, 3.5 meters wide and weighing about 50 tons, is a state-protected
        natural monument of national significance. The stone is located in the northern part of Klaipeda city, in
        Tauralaukis, on the left bank of the Danė River.</p>
        <p>Lithuanian researchers of the beginning of the 20th century emphasized that this stone was mentioned in
        the chronicles of the Crusaders in 1253, describing the walls of Mėmelis. Researchers of ancient history
        associate the Devils Stone with sacrifices to the ancient Baltic gods (in the mythology of the Balts, the
        devils equivalent is the Velvet), because a bowl has survived on the stone - like a carved well into which
        sacrifices were made. Since the stone is in the former Curonian lands, there is no doubt that the
        ancestors in that bowl, among other victims, burned amber.</p>
        <p>Tauralaukis stone feeds:<br>
        The lord of Tauralaukis manor really enjoyed playing cards on the stone. Once he played there with his
        worker, and he lost, he was very angry, he says to the gentleman, "Go to hell." On the night of John the
        gentleman went to the stone and met the devil here, who had a bag full of money. The devil lost all that
        money to the landlord, became very angry, and gave it to the stone with his hand so that the mark of his
        hand remained on the stone. According to others, the landlord had won the Devils money but could not
        use it - the money was poured into hot tar during the day, and at night it shone like hot iron. The landlord
        still did not have peace, he was persecuted by the ghosts of the farmers (who lost to the devil) who had
        been killed by the Devil. The gentleman began to hover over the stone at night, planning to give the devil
        money. The devils cry was taken, but the wicked did not appear, then the landowner buried the money
        under the stone, and as soon as he did so, the Devil appeared. Asking where his money is. The landlord
        says, "I buried." Dig. The landlord is looking - no more. Then the devil sat him on the neck and jumped
        into the depths of the river Akmena.</p>
        <p>He agreed to cross with the devil to gamble on stone cards (he was given the Tauralaukiai manor). On
        St. John’s night, they were both at the stone. He started gambling, the crusader was unlucky, then he
        came up with the idea to draw crosses on the cards, and from there the Devil shook like a mat. The Devil
        was no longer lucky. He fevered, jumped around the stone, and finally the rooster crowed. Then the
        enraged Devil dug his hand into the stone, and he fell deeply, and as he ran away, he grabbed the cross
        by the neck, and at the same time sank into the depths of Dane. In this place, still today, the mud and
        spins are spinning (in fact, the stone is currently lying on the bay of swampy Dane).</p>
        <p>As the Baltic tribes rose from the old place to the new place, they had to stop at the river where there
        was a large stone, similar in shape to a table. Gentainiai decided to eat on the river bank and sent two
        brothers to the reconnaissance - Elnia and Vilkas. A deer walking along the right bank of the river
        reached the estuary leading to the sea. Returning to the agreed place and not finding a brother, he went
        in search of his nicknamed feet to the swamp, where the brothers footprints ended in a large viscous
        foot. This is where the Wolf played. His tribesmen decided to stay at that creepy swamp to make it
        harder for the enemy to reach their camp. And when he had laid the hand of the chief captain on the
        great stone, he defined and struck down the image thereof. That sign meant that the area was a hunting
        ground for this genus. Klaipėda named the newly established settlement at the mouth of the Danė River.
        The new ruler of Tauralaukis laid his hand on the big stone and expressed his will - to break the stone
        and draw the ingots for the foundations of the manor. But as soon as the stone-breakers began work,
        they were soon injured. Rumors have spread around the area about the stone obsessed with the devil in
        Tauralauki. As the gentleman tried to persuade the people to break the stone, no one went. This is how
        the Devils Stone has survived to this day in Tauralaukai, on the banks of the Dane River.</p>
